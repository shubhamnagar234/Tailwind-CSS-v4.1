# Tailwind-CSS-v4.1
A repository exploring Tailwind CSS v4.1. Moves beyond basics to advanced theming, responsive design, dark mode, and custom grid layouts. Covers deep mapping of CSS properties, complex states (hover/focus), SVG animations, and custom functions/derivatives. Culminates in a comprehensive final project.
